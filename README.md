# üß† Alzheimer's Disease Progression Prediction

This project aims to predict the progression of Alzheimer's Disease using a deep learning model trained on MRI scan images. The system classifies brain images into four categories: **Non-Demented**, **Very Mild Demented**, **Mild Demented**, and **Moderate Demented**.

## üìù Project Overview

- **Domain**: Medical Imaging / Deep Learning
- **Dataset Source**: Kaggle ‚Äì [Alzheimer‚Äôs Dataset (4 Class of Images)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images)
- **Model Type**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Framework Used**: TensorFlow / Keras
- **Platform**: Google Colab

## üë©‚Äçüíª Author Info

- **Name**: A. M. Santina Appalo
- **Class**: CSE - D5 - III Year  

## üìÅ Dataset Structure

The dataset includes 4 classes:
- `NonDemented`
- `VeryMildDemented`
- `MildDemented`
- `ModerateDemented`

Images are split into `train`, `test`, and `validation` folders.

## üß™ Installation and Setup

To run the notebook on Google Colab:

1. Install and authenticate the Kaggle API:
   ```python
   !pip install -q kaggle
   from google.colab import files
   files.upload()  # Upload your kaggle.json
   ```

2. Configure Kaggle credentials:
   ```bash
   !mkdir ~/.kaggle
   !cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
   !chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
   ```

3. Download and unzip dataset:
   ```bash
   !kaggle datasets download -d tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images
   !unzip alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images.zip -d ./data/
   ```

## üß† Model Description

The CNN model was designed and trained to process grayscale MRI images. The architecture includes:
- Multiple convolutional and max-pooling layers
- Flatten layer
- Dense layers with dropout
- `softmax` activation for multiclass classification

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**
- **Loss**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Classification Report**

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning with learning rate schedulers
- Integration with web-based diagnostic tools
- Real-time MRI scan image prediction
